Tic Tac Toe

### Instructions to run from source:
in the Vscode terminal make sure you're cd'd in the project directory then do `python -m venv env`.

Then run:
`.\env\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment.

At this point the terminal should say (env).

Then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary modules required to build the project.

And you're done. If you run `pip list` it should display all the modules/libraries that we are using.

TO RUN ANY FILE - make sure your virtual env is activated and do `python fileName.py`

Make sure you `pip install` ANY modules that you're gonna use through the virtual environment, and run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate an updated requirements.txt file.

MAKE SURE THAT YOUR GENERATED `env` FOLDER IS IN .gitignore.
